# WQU_capstone_VIX
This is code implementation part of WQU capstone project. It contains two strategy:  
1. Replicate the VXX returns with VIX futures, and long the VIX futures,  
2. short VXX Trade VXI futures and VXX with the goal to minimize returns vol, and transaction cost

The code can only be ran on the Quantconnect(https://www.quantconnect.com/) platform, and for the second strategy, it requires vol data from quandl (https://www.quandl.com/)
